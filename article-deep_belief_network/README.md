# Deep Belief Network: The hidden hero behind the Deep Learning (r)evolution 

Welcome to an article dedicated to the Deep Belief Network discussion! Be ready to 
discover some dark magic and impressive algorithms behind modern generative AI.
## Article Summary

The proposed article focuses on the discussion of Deep Belief Networks (DBN), a type of 
stochastic neural network, one of the first algorithms to prove the feasibility of 
unsupervised learning and hidden layers. It highlights the extensive usage of DBNs in 
different tasks, such as generation, recognition and feature extraction, focusing the 
implementation on digit classification based on the MNIST dataset.

## Getting Started

Follow the following steps to check how Deep Belief Networks work for classification
of handwritten digits!


1. **Create a New Project**: Create a new empty Python Project on your device and navigate 
to the project directory.

    ```sh
    cd my-dbn-project
    ```

2. **Prepare Your Environment**: Before you begin, make sure you have a virtual environment set up for your project. If not, create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```sh
    python -m venv dbn_env
    source dbn_env/bin/activate      # On Windows: .\dbn_env\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Copy the source code**: Inside the empty directory, add the file with the provided
source (`dbn_implementation.py`) code and the requirements (`requirements.txt`).

4. **Install Requirements**: Inside your virtual environment, install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Run the source code**: To run the source code provided for the DBN, use the command
provided below. It can take some time, as the MNIST dataset should be installed.

    ```sh
    python dbn_implementation.py
    ```

## Next Steps

Now that you have successfully run the provided source code, consider optimizing some 
hyperparameters or making your own DBN implementation for a different task (you may 
consider fraud detection or text classification based on topics).
