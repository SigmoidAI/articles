2018-09-24,again as i said a month ago sep is tough for trading so either just sit and watch now waiting for mkt to settle or play very small and quick oct totally different story,2
2018-09-10,mkt not a reversal here to at least not yet still can go either way say again do not gamble if you have small acct this mkt right now is not for u just sit it out and watch otherwise use very small playing,1
2018-09-10,amzn can go either way here 5 moving average might dead cross 10 moving average today depending on price actions and volume macd already dead cross on daily 1977 1952 are both key levels to watch if hike and drop below 1952 very bad and possibly go to 1882 in 2 weeks,2
2018-09-12,very clear strategy today nflx tsla both super strong while other tech names weak so why waste ur spreading out to other weak names and try to buy on dip focus is key amzn if goes to 1966 or around that level will be on my radar again,3
2018-09-24,spx dow drop more than nasdaq to exactly the opposite from last week remember 3 quarter approaching end this week to tons funds need to adjust their holdings only bargain in major tech names now is nflx which has not moved anywhere past 3 months so could be favor of big funds,1
2018-09-18,spx back to 2906 key level daily and hourly chart much better like tech names spx also back to where drop started when this kind of strong bounce all happened in one day its typically pretty strong mkt signal lets see if reversal confirmed,3

2018-09-04,great run for amzn nvda today still room to run googl not good breaking down 1217 as i twitted earlier this morning but 1206 could be hard bottom to watch this level closely nflx needs a bit more consolidation to weekly chart still great,4
2018-09-10,nflx keep in mind the big picture is falling wedge break out on daily chart but technically need to form right shoulder around 331 level for a strong bounce another run above 61.8 percent level 357.4 will confirm reversal to uptrend,3
2018-09-07,mkt looking good on this bottom bounce but be careful if stock or mkt cant pass over 5 moving average on daily to if thats the case see strong bounce then 5 moving average dead cross 10 moving average on daily for a huge dip but if volume good on bounce may see it power through 5 moving average which will lead to huge hike,3
2018-09-19,remember what i said googl to big red candle followed by long upstick today we need a long bottom stick green candle for reversal and it did amzn same rationale but chart not as good as googl their put plays ystd big loss turn into big profits today earlier tmr another day,1
2018-09-10,keep in mind so many names are a bit far from daily 5 moving average but still in downtrend or weak bounce be careful this week to things can go either way easily and fast,4
2018-09-11,i for when mkt finds a bottom nvda should be the go to name as its chart is the best among all big tech names except for amd of course,3
2018-09-23,futures down magic number for nqf is 7502 if it can pull back to 7502 and pull up with a long bottom stick before mkt opens tmr am not impossible to see a good run but if drops through 7502 mkt in trouble if drops below 7470 mkt drop might accelerate for another 50 points,2
2018-09-10,seeing a lot of people already going into next week acting like it’s a buy the dip on names like googl fb tsla nflx you will get destroyed thinking like this play the trend right now trend is down until we see signs of reversals stop fighting the trend keep things simple,4

2018-10-09,amzn better chart after ystds drop to cloud bottom on daily which is also mid bb on weekly need hike above 1878.4 to 1881 range to thatd confirm a strong bounce play still not impossible to see 1896 1908 or even 1933 this week if mkt starts to recover here,2
2018-10-25,also if they liquidate aapl itll obviously tank and that will obliterate the market remember aapl has the biggest weight on the entire sp500 including the nasdaq a sharp selloff on aapl will crush the indices due to its weight alone pray that they dont sell aapl laugh,1
2018-10-08,markets rebound from early sell off dow closes up 40 points erasing a slide of 224 points during morning trading nasdaq loses 0.7 percent as tech stocks continue to struggle tesla falls 4 percent google owner alphabet and amazon slide 1 percent,1
2018-10-08,ugly overall spy qqq dia market no plays for me now remember sept and october statistically the months with the most market crashes and leaders like amzn which is now down 9 percent in 6 days usually fade first before a big crash so be safe,1
2018-10-19,for a second consecutive day post earnings nflx seen negative cmf to big flooding out nothing to do with its own biz but probably due to fear of mkt fluctuation as i said this earning season could be the worst in 5 year s starting with nflx be very careful into rest of,1
2018-10-03,amzn rejected twice by cloud top on 15 minute chart its key name in mkt today not aapl which doesnt matter now as everyone knows its going up but amzn is really deciding force for nq to see ath so keep an eye on it,3
2018-10-14,just as i predicted in past newsletters investors are crowding into hiding ina small number of large cap techs aapl msft etc as they did in late 2000 and again in 2008 these stocks are holding up the major market indices and masking the broad and deep declines in the tech sector,5
2018-10-31,now it all comes to appl earnings new month starts tmr big drop in october make monthly chart very interesting now as on monthly both far far above if aapl good esf to 2782 to 2796 nqf to 7136 to 7211 next week possible,3
2018-10-24,futures esf nqf setting up very interesting on daily to with 5 moving average sharply downwards but 10 moving average up could see a dip on wednesday then pull up to form a bottom to but amzn earnings definitely have big impact afterwards,4
2018-10-25,slight revenue misses but big earnings beats at both amzn and goog cloud businesses slightly weaker than expected too market could read results either way as of now reacting negatively should be fascinating trading tomorrow dip buyers might have been lured into trap today,2
2018-10-29,so many people are saying aapl fb earnings can save the mkt really if earnings good may save the tech for a day or two or 1 to 2 week bounce but that has nothing to do with mkt bottom reversal i said again and again this er season could see stock performance worst in 5 year s,1
2018-10-09,read charts to if you dont do it you know nothing about levels or why stocks up or down amzn to cloud top on 30 minute but far away from 5 moving average on 60 minute to thats why it pops and fades read charts is a must,3
2018-10-09,amzn needs break out 1896 tmr wednesday if it does see 1908 or even 1934 fast nflx needs break out 357.4 on wednesday if it does see 364 coming today is vital as they cant fade too much and must close above 1864 and 349 respectively otherwise big fade into tmr,3
2018-10-08,technically if today mkt see bottom on hourly chance we see amzn back to 1934 nflx back to 364 nvda back to 274 this week but that doesnt mean u should go for those aggressive price strikes as ups and downs during the process will kill otm premiums fast and easy,3
2018-10-11,esf spy touching 50 moving average on daily see if amzn supported here if it does back up to 1742 easily 1750 calls now 11 if you wanna play to high risk this time signing off here gotta go for fishing,1
2018-10-16,nflx earnings can go either way and other techs will follow if you wanna play both sides to maximize your potential gains high open this morning could be good entry for puts oct19 290 puts 3.1 good to consider as one of those options but if u do it get calls later,3
2018-10-02,wow these amzn 1980 puts now 26 from 12.6 if you still have it was not liking amzn chart earlier today but that bounce was very good now bounce dead next support 1955,1
2018-10-23,qqq oct26 172 puts now 1.35 good to consider to i dont feel mkt set up a bottom here 5 moving average may dead cross 10 moving average on daily chart tmr so at this point only consider this as a strong technical bounce not a bottom reversal if nq break out falling wedge thatd be more convincing,3
2018-10-22,remember one thing to premiums still very high for most of tech names so ups and downs kill premiums fast again this mkt is not for small acct owners this is not ur game,1
2018-10-12,dow soars 400 points or 1.6 percent at the open rally follows two day slide that erased 1378 points from the dow nasdaq surges 2.3 percent SP500 500 gains 1.6 percent netflix amazon and apple all rise sharply citigroup jumps 4 percent on strong earnings watch live,1

2018-10-26,mkt bounced a bit from a deep hole overnight spy qqq nflx tlry puts from ystd gonna pay very well remember to lock gains and then wait for mkt to settle it’s again time for premium re balancing so no need to take risks here to just progressively lock gains and relax today,4
2018-10-19,only saver of all tech now is aapl to monthly chart still like a beast but if falls to below 5 moving average on monthly everything bullish ends for it and gap fill downside to 190.29 thatd literally pull down all tech no matter what kind of fantastic er they have e g nflx,1
2018-10-16,tech leading strong bounce here calls pay very nicely puts down a lot remember you need both sides of plays if you plan to hold into nflx earnings,5
2018-10-24,the overall markets are now taking out morning and multi week lows the dia spy qqq are all down roughly 10 percent from their recent highs all of you should be safe as my warnings are finally paying off,1

2018-10-15,hope you all listened to me and did not not participate in mkt today exactly as i said ore market today just premium killing lots of tech names with otm call price falling by 30 to 50 percent otm puts also dropping absolutely no need to trade anything,1

2019-01-31,reactions after earnings so far aapl great fb super ba super msft bad nflx bad but actually not bad er if amzn miss or only making small moves either way mkt spx comp not gonna be affected significantly as all eyes on googl now mkt always reward strong names,4

2019-01-19,big picture to mkt started this dip from 2800 on dec3 till dec24 16 days total reversed on dec26 and ran 16 days to ystd jan18 is day 17 and set up tone dec3 level is key reference names that haven’t reached dec3 levels will do fb amzn nflx googl spx comp bac nvda ba,1
2019-01-06,big picture to theres a reason why msft is now in mkt cap to trade deal does not even matter to msft it already has huge mkt depth in china so during this tech led mkt downside move msft dropped 18 percent from top fb negative 44 percent aapl negative 39 percent amzn negative 36 percent nflx negative 45 percent googl negative 24 percent nvda negative 57 percent,1
2019-01-11,es nq still high risk into next week spx comp qqq spy all inside candle so far on daily meaning technically might see a hike to daily 50 moving average first then down big to touch rising daily 10 moving average or even mid bb how spx comp close today will be key anyway be very careful next week,1
2019-01-16,yes i predicted this january huge tech bounce back in dec as i said back then monthly 5 moving average is key indicator telling where we will go from here nflx earnings set up tone for rest but theres only one nflx and other tech not likely see good er so be careful into feb,1
2019-01-31,premium killing for amzn but as i said good for mkt overall especially googl friday likely a rotation day to dow so possibly see ba run big googl also going to attract significant big dollars,3
2019-01-16,amzn calls already 40 percent and and possibly gonna double tmr am if mkt good tsla still chance to run cmg still good set up but progressively locked with only lotto size my point is there are gonna be days like today where u didnt do well while mkt crazy thats ok fight another day,3
2019-01-31,amzn numbers are great actually super but guidance not so exciting see how it develops remember if amzn up but only small moves still good for mkt especially googl,4
2019-01-02,nflx jan4 250 puts now 3.3 good to consider need it to drop below 255 today for this put to work if amzn leading tech for strong bounce nflx may see 264 again before dropping so know the risk,3
2019-01-28,tech calls no good nflx spy put hedge covered nvda remaining calls plus amzn pre earning call loss then xlnx tlry call big profits logic is very simple to big flowing into strong names that give assurance to thats xlnx,1
2019-01-25,spx comp spy qqq esf nqf all have spectacular view on daily chart to look at the cloud shape now price levels about to move into the huge falling cloud nqf esf actually already stepped right into it 50 moving average still moving downwards monday will see huge move either way,2
2019-01-02,also keep in mind for so many names especially tech names weekly 5 moving average still sharply downwards this week so if powell yellen bernanke have consistent views on friday mkt can dive huge to spx possibly see 150 points drop in one day but if good talk can reverse weekly 5 moving average back up,4
2019-01-24,money flowing into amzn googl ystd as they both are approaching earnings googl back to mid bb on daily amzn close how daily 5 moving average changes today is key tell remember everything before earnings is about premiums not potentials trade on facts not assumptions,1
2019-01-15,all eyes on amzn today if it falls everything follows if it hikes tech all up can go either way 1646 1594 are two threshold references,1
2019-01-27,many say mkt has reversed from bearish to bullish again as i said still in bearish mkt until proved otherwise now just monthly chart strong tech bounce need spx conclude 2791 comp conclude 7486 for feb or march to confirm reversal before that happens nothing changed,2
2019-01-16,nflx earnings on thursday 387 is key to tell if er great and move over 387 pretty sure we see ath coming in 2 to 3 weeks amzn googl feb calls gonna up huge due to premium rebalancing if earnings no good nflx back to 311 possible but set up amzn for a good er run,3
2019-01-30,aapl earnings set up the tone only for wed morning nothing more than that tech can run but need higher high on daily to mean something if anything all eyes on fed report tomorrow afternoon thats way more significant than aapl earnings,3
2019-01-10,nflx strongest among tech due to its er scheduled next thursday so if big starts to buy dip in tech nflx will be the first one to go green use it as reference if it starts to dip and see lower low again veyr bad for mkt,5
2019-01-07,spx up comp up but dow just so so compared with spx comp but keep in mind wmt today break out upside consolidation channel and moved up see if it can test daily 50 moving average tmr if wmt good and ba follows dow gonna up big tmr to pushing spx comp for another higher high then likely fade,3
2019-01-15,aapl raises prices by about 10 percent customers can still choose not to buy this cycle but remain engaged analysts horrible no good doomed strategy nflx raises by 13 to 18 percent with no choice effective immediately analysts hell yeaaah rinse and repeat evry year or 2 4 ever,1
2019-01-17,remember what i said about vix to lower low green ystd on daily chart and weekly 5 moving average start to flat not impossible to see it back to 23 if mkt no good with nflx earnings,2
2019-01-06,this whole 6 year bull mkt run started with new tech revolution to thats why we see all hiking 5 to 10 times so theres only one chance we see bear mkt reversal to trade deal done and china opens internet and tech mkt to fb amzn nflx googl if that happens mkt reverse fast and furious,1

2019-01-08,googl intc stronger than amzn nflx here and 1 minute chart of googl intc looks pretty similar very interesting,4
2019-01-23,as i said earlier this morning if you play tech calls you need hedge amzn googl hedge both big win nvda calls were up a lot to progressively lock gains and hold rest you need to know where to put a stop no one can make the decision for you,2
2019-01-18,huge winning day with nvda googl amzn calls and tsla puts signing off for now stay calm size your plays have a plan ready dont gamble progressively lock and cash out to bank acct,1
2019-01-31,all tech names consolidating and waiting for amzn no matter how it ends make sure you size your plays and have a strategy for your plays absolutely high risk into tomorrow as anything can happen with amzn trade on facts not assumptions and emotions remember tmr is february,1

2019-02-04,futures very clear es higher low but nq lower low so nq needs a huge bullish engulfing on daily otherwise not good signal into googl’s earnings,2
2019-02-25,es nq both strong ba nflx fb tsla nvda calls from friday all gonna be great again amzn aapl will be key indicator of market strength starting today not just looking at nflx ba,5
2019-02-01,all eyes on googl today for sure and goodl is not making an exciting move after morning hike so without the leading name moving big fears mkt fading thats what determines everything into this pm,3
2019-02-25,locked most positions to take gains held many calls over weekend including ba nflx fb nvda tsla big win today no need to take further big risks holding some remaining calls but not big positions now relax and watch how mkt goes,4
2019-02-01,amzn all is about 30 minute chart mid bb now still sharply down when this mid bb turn flat we will see some price actions again no reason playing it now premium needs to cool down first and its googl time if amzn good and start to bounce googl will also go up,2
2019-02-24,clearly fb nflx ba baba all winning with substantial margin while aapl amzn nvda tsla substantially lagged behind particularly nvda aapl both big losers can also mean potential room keep in mind comp indu already passed over dec3 levels yet far from oct10 level,2
2019-02-15,i said again and again mkt will back to dec 3 level since early jan very very close to that level now said use nflx as indicator and reference ba also another indicator if we power through dec3 level like a piece of cake it means back to bull mkt otherwise big dip,2
2019-02-25,ba nflx been leading mkt for weeks but for mkt to power through and close above 2824 which would be key signal if we could get back to bull mkt to it will definitely need aapl amzn to go up and lead the whole tech sector up otherwise still narrow upside range consolidation,3
2019-02-15,tech in deep red especially leading names nflx was up big now back in red if you did not progressively lock gains now profits probably all gone as warned earlier this morning be very careful about mkt especially tech names,1
2019-02-01,aapl lower low lower high closed below mid bb with 5 moving average dead cross 10 moving average in this case its the best dead cross you could expect given the lower low and 5 moving average far far up as thats bottom signal need close feb or mar above 176 to confirm reversal back to bullish trend,4
2019-02-13,nflx was the leading indicator of mkt as it was the first to reach and break out dec 3 level to which i mentioned again and again is vital reference strong close today open up room for a run to 61.8 percent fib 385 if through see 78.6 percent 427 if mkt reverse back to bull see 480 this year,5
2019-02-26,amzn weekly macd golden cross but 5 moving average about to dead cross 10 moving average unless pulling up above 1680 this week to pull up the 5 moving average daily chart macd about to golden cross with bottom shape formation todays hike but closed 1632 resist if mkt good 1672 1681 1695 1718 resist above,1
2019-02-28,also note that es nq monthly chart 5 moving average both turning upwards into march which is very bullish signal so even if we see pullback in short term mkt should continue to run after some consolidation esf nqf,3
2019-02-24,these two charts also show that individuals stocks except googl bac msft wmt all fluctuate way more intensively than index spx comp indu as mkt moves up or down since oct10 big drop,2
2019-02-05,how high this mkt can go depends on only two names now to ba and nflx one decides dow the other decides nasdaq,1
2019-02-06,tech heavy sell need amzn googl nflx all bottomed otherwise no good know where to stop if you do play tech calls,1
2019-02-12,futures looking different es higher high nq ym weaker for all three daily chart 5 moving average pointing downwards to so again be very careful about mkt,3
2019-02-19,aapl very bad chart no reason playing it same with amzn which is actually strong today but only use it as reference for mkt,1
2019-02-13,nflx 30 minute chart 5 moving average turning upwards now good signal need 60 minute chart 5 moving average turning upwards too this pm remember it needs to close above 359 today otherwise need to be very careful,3
2019-02-20,nflx has been leading indicator of mkt since late dec today after open it hiked and faded would that be a preplay of what mkt gonna do after fed this pm no idea but be very very careful into fed,3
2019-02-21,day is over early today nothing to watch really mkt drops and bounces no reason playing big size plays or watch from sideline tmr will be interesting as signal will be clear into next week signing off from here,1
2019-02-26,very nice win this morning on fb nflx nvda plays remember to progressively lock gains no reason playing heavy or taking big risk at this point mkt could range for a while before making another move either way so premiums could drop fast,5
2019-02-25,tech rotation very obvious this morning big flowing out of nflx and going into aapl fb but not necessarily amzn googl actually googl very weak and no reason playing it see if new pulling up nflx again its been key mkt indicator since christmas,1
2019-02-04,google earnings is the most exciting one this year not because i am playing tech calls into it earnings but instead it will determine the fate of entire tech sector for rest of year also we will know if googl beats up amzn aapl msft in competition for mkt cap no 1,5
2019-02-04,everyone was doubting earlier last week if mkt would continue to run up or what late last week most pro traders would not even think about buying back on dip this morning with ba fb googl nflx all set up very nicely most should know what to do upon open,5
2019-02-04,very clear strategy here play fb nflx for googl earnings if googl runs super fb nflx both run big especially fb to lots of potential if break out 172 key resistance can see 180 to 184 easily if googl no good fb any pullback will be gift entry,4
2019-02-01,signing off here a great day with all the morning plays i kept reminding you all to progressively lock gains and hope you all listened googl earnings on monday anything can happen this weekend size remaining positions for all names you are playing enjoy football weekend,5

2019-02-21,two key references are ba nflx both red if mkt ever reverse today these two will be first to show signals now both weak if these two drops more mkt goes down way more,2

2019-03-28,the selloff in tech today found support and its no coincidence where qqq stalled at 176.50 which is support of a large wedge in play since the lows green on chart it can still fill out more but after last weeks fake upside break it should break down to my 174 target at least,1
2019-03-08,spy gapping down this morning to open dead on the 200 day ma after 5 back to back down days and with a noticable uptick in bearish sentiment on twitter looks ripe for a nice snap back bounce in my opinion,1
2019-03-06,nflx was leading indicator of mkt for 2 months along with ba ba very weak today meaning dow not likely strong but the fact tech retaking control of mkt past few days suggests that tech leaders will move nflx today not consistent with mkt rhythm good signal,2

2019-03-05,seen many people on twitter calling on nflx big reversal today id say be very cautious to at least watch how it goes for a bit longer logic is simple ba nflx both leading mkt they both dropped as amzn googl aapl took over past few days today ba still weak so careful,2
2019-03-22,now reflecting on this whole bull run and this big dip and bounce which tech name is the strongest to everyones surprise its msft as we already see ath it makes sense though as its not affected by trade deal or macro policy nflx amzn will be super again,5

2019-03-05,remember when mkt spx comp dip deep ystd fb was super strong amzn aapl googl all were ok so when rotation started as i have been saying rotating out of nflx new market leader emergence means former leader ba nflx will turn weak,2
2019-03-21,if you know charts you know how to play amzn nflx very straightforward bounce on hourly chart mid bb support can progressively lock some gains if you added when price dropped to hourly mid bb,3

2019-03-22,when everything down huge two names bounced back way faster than all other major names to key dec 3 level to thats ba nflx now ba in big trouble but nflx break out key 366 again thanks to aapl event nflx didnt fly while msft led and see ath now nflx will follow and ath incoming,1

2019-03-01,nflx googl amzn better than aapl fb so far this morning as i said amzn very strong resistance above off the down pressuring upper boll on daily chart nflx narrowing consolidation and need to get back above 364 googl strongest technical set up and break out key 1137 resist,5
2019-03-04,completely sidelined into tuesday no reason taking any more risk into tmr still a great day with amzn spy calls although half profits gone profits are profits and happy about it tue wed will be interesting for tech,1
2019-03-04,progressively took loss on most remaining calls had only a few left profits from this morning amzn spy calls gone roughly half with ba nflx spy loss caught in surprise with the magnitude of this drop but as i said need to progressively lock gains or take loss,2
2019-03-27,ive rolled my shtputs 500 times and am still convinced this is the month likewise the tsla total return for longs of 0.69 percent annualized lags the qqq total return of 4200 percent amazon was bought out by wework in 2023 and now provides housing and goods to 86 percent of all americans,1
2019-03-13,think of the market like a store the indexes are the signage the lights and the doors and the stocks are the merchandise if the lights are on the doors are open and theres a neon we are open sign flashing can you buy something if there is no merchandise on the shelves,1
2019-03-02,amzn big move on friday and had a big win with calls resisted almost precisely at the 1675 level i mentioned now macd strengthening as i said amzn is one of very few names yet lagged behind dec 3 level 1778 resistance 1675 1682 1693 1700 1719 1726 1731 1737 1756 1778,1
2019-03-18,learning making a big difference if you did not study charts this past weekend you would not know the key levels and patterns on charts so would almost certainly miss amzn nflx nvda run this morning or if you already had calls you might jumped out of boat way too early,4
2019-03-06,remember what i said logic very simple to if top already formed and we start to drop big from here no reason we see strong tech names today such as fb msft googl plus old mkt leader ba also strong today see if we see reversal here very interesting day indeed,5
2019-03-19,amzn had a great day powered through key 1731 level easily resistance above 1755 1766 1778 and this is only major tech name on the mkt that has not yet reached back up to dec 3 level 1778,4
2019-03-11,nvda bottom reversal on support of daily chart cloud bottom last friday then today hiking huge on acquisition news note that tmr and wed will likely see first time breaking out of daily chart cloud since october 2018 if it confirms break out out of cloud see 169 175 then to 202,1
2019-03-15,been saying amzn is the only major tech that has not reached back to dec 3 level 1778 now its all over the twitter everyone saying it but let me remind you this to if you dont understand amzn chart dont play it people may lose big even on this upside move,1
2019-03-15,es indeed pulled back to 2824 into close keep in mind spx comp both highest close since the key oct10 level which was the starting point of this whole bearish trend of mkt talking about the significance of today march 15 very very few even talking about this,1
2019-03-02,again if you have not realized the tremendous value of this twit i strongly recommend you dig into it this weekend this is my 2 most valuable 2019 twit since my 1 twit back at beginning of jan about mkt and stocks going back to dec 3 level amzn googl aapl nflx ba,5
2019-03-12,for many names like aapl amzn not likely break out upper boll on hourly chart today so very likely see a pull back to rising mid bb on hourly chart,3
2019-03-04,nflx led the whole tech for weeks then narrow range consolidation to it should have dipped back to 300 level but that did not happen which says enough about its strength same as amzn should have dipped to 1480 in jan but did not happen key level is 366 if break out 371 374 382,2
2019-03-03,remember two big names that have not yet bounced back to their dec 3 levels amzn dec 3 level at 1778 and aapl dec 3 level at 184 if both names run this week can pull up all tech,1
2019-03-04,best day of 2019 with amzn spy call plays from friday added more amzn this morning on open and easily doubled calls from last week easily 3 to 5 times locked 80 percent calls around 1706 to 1709 range and patiently wait for another opportunity if it does not pull back so be it,5
2019-03-22,es nq not looking like a bottom today may see lower low next week es 2824 still key level and remember its threshold for bull mkt reversal confirmation so thats a vital level faang all deep red to says enough about mkt weakness,2
2019-03-01,ive said this for 2 months that mkt and everything will go back to dec 3 level and we did but perhaps to your very surprise once the mkt leader amzn substantially lagged behind its dec 3 level is 1778 way more room for upside move and today at key upper boll resist,2
2019-03-04,ba nflx were both mkt leaders for 2 months but today both led this huge drop with 2 percent and in red this could be a cautious signal for whole mkt as they were both mkt indicators remember mar 6 could be vital change for mkt as i said during weekend,2
2019-03-01,looking at monthly chart and weekly chart very surprisingly as i did not expect this googl has the best chart weekly and monthly chart nflx monthly not bad at all but how it concludes this week will be key amzn fb needs time but amzn slightly better aapl worst,3
2019-03-02,lots of twits today but one message to mkt bull run approaching key turning point early leaders nflx fb already seen rotating out ba strong names like amzn googl that substantially lagged behind now catching up mkt possibly only small dip as es nq monthly 5 moving average turning upwards,2
2019-03-05,tech and mkt sell off into close possibly because mar 6 big day moment no idea but as i said size plays into wed and have your plan ready for a potentially wild day,2
2019-03-26,from technical set up standpoint only 3 things to notice for today 1 nflx closed key 366 level at which it failed 15 times 2 amzn was above key 1778 level but closed below it 3 fb closed above key 166 level and is the only major tech name with close above daily chart 5 moving average,2
2019-03-08,great morning if you play amzn ba qqq bounce plays signing off for the day patiently waiting for everything to settle next week remember always another day to make it right so no hurry making or trying to recover if you lost relax rest and have a great weekend,5
2019-03-13,remember my twit from monday es esf did it today so bullish engulfing on weekly chart eating up last week bearish engulfing candle nq nqf way stronger on weekly and already higher high than november and march 2018 high on monthly chart meaning pass over lt trend neckline,1
2019-03-01,amzn approaching key 1664 level see if we see gap up next week could be an epic run all the way to dec 3 level 1778 as i mentioned earlier this morning thats 100 points even from 1664 key level,1
2019-03-02,this is called time for space the fact amzn did not dip probably due to expectations on earnings back then to 1480 level a month ago says everything about its strength also weekly chart mid bb keep pressuring down till this past week now its the time to move,2
2019-03-28,doing best to provide comments about mkt and stocks throughout the day those are key for identifying trend and technicals in the mkt to from my own point of view if you connect all the dots you will see how i see things from technical lens and how i trade,4
2019-03-31,whats interesting on monthly chart are two things 1 10 moving average around 202 which is also key gap level on daily so we would have seen nvda hit this 202 in march if mkt was good but not happened 2 oct dec big volume but jan mar bounce volume equivalent to good signal as back in,3
